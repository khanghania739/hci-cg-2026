                    An automatic syringe first used a numeric keypad, where one wrong press could make the dose ten
                    times
                    too high or too low. In the final design, each digit had separate increment and decrement buttons,
                    which
                    made it much safer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This shows how small design changes can prevent serious mistakes. Designers create early prototypes
                    that
                    are simple and easy to change. By testing with real users, they learn what causes errors and improve
                    the
                    interface step by step. Iterative design helps make systems safer, easier to use, and more reliable.

                <p><strong>Stages of Human Thinking</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Sensation: </strong>First, we notice things around us using our senses like seeing, hearing, or touching.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attention: </strong>We focus on some things and ignore others.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perception: </strong>Our brain makes sense of what we notice and understands what’s happening.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learning: </strong>We gain new knowledge or skills from experiences or lessons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory: </strong>We keep information in our brain to use later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forgetting: </strong>Sometimes we lose or forget information over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thinking: </strong>We use our mind to analyze information and form ideas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem-Solving: </strong>We use what we know to find answers to problems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reasoning: </strong>We use logic to understand problems and decide what to do.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Making: </strong>Finally, we make choices or take action based on everything we thought about.</li>

            <h2 class="color-4">Who Paid Problem</h2>

            <article class="color-3">
                <p>
                    The "Who Paid?" problem happens whenever a group of friends shares expenses, like during a trip, a dinner, or an outing. Even small payments can create tension if someone forgets or if tracking who owes what becomes confusing. For example, in a trip where one person paid for everything, it can take days to settle payments, and reminders may feel awkward.
                </p>
                
                <p>Using Norman's Action  Cycle:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Goal: </strong>Settle payments fairly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plan: </strong>Check the app and remind friends.</li>
                    <li><strong>Execution: </strong>Send reminders or pay your part.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perceive: </strong>See who has paid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interpret: </strong>Understand why some haven’t paid yet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compare: </strong>Check if the goal was achieved.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This shows that apps like Splitwise aren’t just about money—they mediate social interactions, and poor design can create stress, confusion, or frustration.</p>
